  * gdb:
    * type [help] at the gdb command prompt to get more helpful information.
    * type [man gdb] or [info gdb] at a unix terimal to get more helpful information.

  * objdump -t:
    * print out the binary executable [symbol table], The symbol table includes the 
    names of all functions and global variables in the binary, the names of all the 
    functions the binary calls, and their addresses.

  * objdump -d:
    * Use this to disassemble all of the code in the binary executable, it's can al
    so just look at individual functions.
    * Although objdump -d gives you a lot of information, it doesnâ€™t tell you the w
    hole story. Calls to system-level functions are displayed in a cryptic form. Fo
    r example, a call to sscanf might appearas:
      - 8048c36:  e8 99 fc ff ff  call   80488d4 <_init+0x1a0>
    To determine that the call was tosscanf, you would need to disassemble within gdb.
  
  * strings:
    * This utility will display the printable strings in your binary executable.
