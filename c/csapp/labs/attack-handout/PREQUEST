FILES:
  * ctarget: involes three code injection attack.

  * rtarget: involes two return-oriented programming attack.

  * hex2rax: Encode each exploit string as a sequence of hex digit pairs separa-
             ted by whitespace, where each hex digit pair represents a byte in 
             the exploit string. The program "hex2raw" converts these strings i-
             nto a sequence of raw bytes, which can then be fed to the target:

                unix> cat exploit.txt | ./hex2raw | ./ctarget
